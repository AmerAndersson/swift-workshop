# Let's break down both of these examples

1. **`let sum = numbers.reduce(0, +)`**:
   - This line of code calculates the sum of all elements in the `numbers` array.
   - Here's how it works:
     - `numbers` is an array containing integers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`).
     - The `reduce` method takes two arguments:
       - The initial value (`0` in this case).
       - The closure (`+`) that specifies how to accumulate the result.
     - The closure (`+`) is an operator function that adds two values together.
     - The `reduce` method iterates through each element in the array and accumulates the result by adding each element to the running total.
     - The final result is the sum of all elements in the array.
   - In this specific example:
     - `1 + 2 + 3 + 4` equals `10`, which becomes the value of `sum`.

2. **`let totalSum = nestedArray.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.reduce(0, +) }`**:
   - This line of code calculates the sum of all elements in a nested array (`nestedArray`).
   - Here's how it works:
     - `nestedArray` is an array of arrays (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`).
     - The outer `reduce` method starts with an initial value of `0`.
     - The closure `{ $0 + $1.reduce(0, +) }` is applied to each inner array:
       - `$0` represents the running total (initialized to `0`).
       - `$1` represents each inner array (e.g., `[1, 2]`, `[3, 4]`, `[5, 6]`).
       - The inner `reduce` method is used to sum the elements within each inner array.
       - For example, `[1, 2]` sums to `3`, `[3, 4]` sums to `7`, and `[5, 6]` sums to `11`.
       - The outer `reduce` accumulates these intermediate sums.
     - The final result is the sum of all elements across all inner arrays: `3 + 7 + 11 = 21`.
   - Therefore, `totalSum` is `21`.

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
let sum = numbers.reduce(0, +) // Result: 10

let nestedArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
let totalSum = nestedArray.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.reduce(0, +) } // Result: 21
```
