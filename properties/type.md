# Type properties in Swift are associated with the type itself (class, structure, or enumeration), rather than individual instances. They allow you to define values that are consistent across all instances of a particular type. Here are some common use cases for type properties

1. **Shared Constants**:

   - Type-level stored properties can be used to define shared constants that are universally applicable to all instances of the type.
   - Example:

     ```swift
     struct MathConstants {
         static let pi = 3.14159
     }
     print("Value of pi: \(MathConstants.pi)")
     ```

   - In this example, `pi` is a type-level constant shared by all instances of `MathConstants`.

2. **Global Configuration Settings**:

   - Type properties are useful for defining global configuration settings that apply to the entire application.
   - For instance, you might have a `Settings` class with type properties for app-specific settings.
   - Example:

     ```swift
     class Settings {
         static var themeColor: UIColor = .blue
         static let maxRetryAttempts = 3
     }
     ```

   - Developers can access these settings without creating an instance of `Settings`.

3. **Singleton Patterns**:

   - Singleton patterns involve creating a single instance of a class throughout the app's lifecycle.
   - Type properties can be used to implement singletons.
   - Example:

     ```swift
     class Logger {
         static let shared = Logger()
         private init() { /* Initialize logger */ }
     }
     let logger = Logger.shared
     ```

   - The `shared` property ensures there's only one instance of `Logger`.

4. **Type-Level Computed Properties**:

   - Type-level computed properties allow you to calculate values based on type-level information.
   - Example:

     ```swift
     struct Circle {
         static func circumference(for radius: Double) -> Double {
             return 2 * Double.pi * radius
         }
     }
     let radius = 5.0
     let circumference = Circle.circumference(for: radius)
     ```

   - The `circumference` method calculates the circumference based on the type-level value of `Double.pi`.

5. **Database Connection Pools**:

   - In server-side Swift applications, type properties can be used to manage database connection pools.
   - The pool maintains a set of reusable database connections.
   - Example:

     ```swift
     struct DatabaseConnectionPool {
         static var connections: [DatabaseConnection] = []
     }
     // Use and release connections as needed
     ```

Remember that type properties are associated with the type itself, not individual instances. They provide a way to share values across all instances of a type. If you have any more questions or need further examples, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š

Certainly! Let's create an example of a `flushDatabaseConnection()` method in Swift. Although Swift itself doesn't have a built-in `flushDatabaseConnection()` method, I'll demonstrate how you might structure a custom property wrapper that includes such functionality.

First, let's create a simple property wrapper called `DatabaseConnectionWrapper`. This wrapper will manage access to a database connection and provide a `flushDatabaseConnection()` method:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct DatabaseConnectionWrapper<Value> {
    private var value: Value
    private var databaseConnection: DatabaseConnection // Assume you have a DatabaseConnection type

    init(wrappedValue: Value, connection: DatabaseConnection) {
        self.value = wrappedValue
        self.databaseConnection = connection
    }

    var wrappedValue: Value {
        get { value }
        set {
            // Perform any necessary operations on the database connection
            // (e.g., saving data, updating records, etc.)
            value = newValue
        }
    }

    var projectedValue: DatabaseConnection {
        return databaseConnection
    }

    func flushDatabaseConnection() {
        // Implement your logic to flush/close the database connection
        // For example:
        databaseConnection.close()
    }
}

// Example usage:
struct User {
    @DatabaseConnectionWrapper(connection: myDatabaseConnection)
    var username: String
}

// Usage:
var user = User(username: "john_doe")
user.username = "jane_doe"
user.$username.flushDatabaseConnection() // Flush the database connection
```

In this example:

- We define a `DatabaseConnectionWrapper` property wrapper that wraps a value (in this case, a `String` representing a username).
- The `wrappedValue` property stores the actual value.
- The `projectedValue` property provides access to the underlying `DatabaseConnection`.
- The `flushDatabaseConnection()` method allows you to explicitly close the database connection.

Remember to replace `DatabaseConnection` with your actual database connection type. Additionally, adapt the logic inside `flushDatabaseConnection()` to match your specific requirements for closing or flushing the connection. ðŸ˜Š
