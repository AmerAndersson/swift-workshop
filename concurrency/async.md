# AsyncSequence Protocol

```swift
@rethrows
protocol AsyncSequence

// AsyncSequence Protocol
// A type that provides asynchronous, sequential, iterated access to its elements.

for await number in Counter(howHigh: 10) {
    print(number, terminator: " ")
}
// Prints "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 "

let found = await Counter(howHigh: 10).contains(5) // true

let stream = Counter(howHigh: 10)
    .map { $0 % 2 == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd" }
for await s in stream {
    print(s, terminator: " ")
}
// Prints "Odd Even Odd Even Odd Even Odd Even Odd Even "

An AsyncSequence resembles the Sequence type — offering a list of values you can step through one at a time — and adds asynchronicity. An AsyncSequence may have all, some, or none of its values available when you first use it. Instead, you use await to receive values as they become available.

As with Sequence, you typically iterate through an AsyncSequence with a for await-in loop. However, because the caller must potentially wait for values, you use the await keyword. The following example shows how to iterate over Counter, a custom AsyncSequence that produces Int values from 1 up to a howHigh value:

An AsyncSequence doesn’t generate or contain the values; it just defines how you access them. Along with defining the type of values as an associated type called Element, the AsyncSequence defines a makeAsyncIterator() method. This returns an instance of type AsyncIterator. Like the standard IteratorProtocol, the AsyncIteratorProtocol defines a single next() method to produce elements. The difference is that the AsyncIterator defines its next() method as async, which requires a caller to wait for the next value with the await keyword.

AsyncSequence also defines methods for processing the elements you receive, modeled on the operations provided by the basic Sequence in the standard library. There are two categories of methods: those that return a single value, and those that return another AsyncSequence.

Single-value methods eliminate the need for a for await-in loop, and instead let you make a single await call. For example, the contains(_:) method returns a Boolean value that indicates if a given value exists in the AsyncSequence. Given the Counter sequence from the previous example, you can test for the existence of a sequence member with a one-line call:

Methods that return another AsyncSequence return a type specific to the method’s semantics. For example, the .map(_:) method returns a AsyncMapSequence (or a AsyncThrowingMapSequence, if the closure you provide to the map(_:) method can throw an error). These returned sequences don’t eagerly await the next member of the sequence, which allows the caller to decide when to start work. Typically, you’ll iterate over these sequences with for await-in, like the base AsyncSequence you started with. In the following example, the map(_:) method transforms each Int received from a Counter sequence into a String:
