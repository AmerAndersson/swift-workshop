# Review process

When you submit your iOS app to the **Apple App Store**, it goes through a review process to ensure a safe and trusted experience for users. Here's how the review process works:

1. **Submission Preparation**:
    - Before submitting your app, make sure you provide the required metadata and choose the correct build for the version.
    - You can submit builds for each platform separately (iOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS), and the status of one platform's build doesn't affect the others.
    - Manage your submissions and messages with the **App Review team** in the **App Review section** of the sidebar.
    - There are four content types that may display in this section:
        - **App Submission**: Includes app versions and/or in-app events that you submitted to App Review, along with related messages.
        - **Beta Build**: Refers to beta versions of your app that you submitted but weren't accepted, along with related messages.
        - **App Review Message**: Other messages from App Review not related to a submission.
        - **Submission Message**: Messages related to a submission sent before the updated submission experience was enabled.
    - You can have one **In Progress submission** at a time per platform.

2. **Submitting an App**:
    - From **Apps**, select your app.
    - In the sidebar, click the app version you want to submit.
    - Scroll down to the **Build section** on the right and verify that you added the correct build for the version.
    - Click **"Add for Review"** on the top right. The app status changes to **Ready for Review**.
    - If you changed any app information, click **"Continue"** in the dialog that appears.
    - You can continue adding items, such as in-app events, to the submission.
    - All items submitted together must be marked as **Accepted** before the submission can be approved.
    - Finally, click **"Submit to App Review"**. The app status changes to **Waiting for Review**, and when the review process starts, it changes to **In Review**¬π.

3. **Submitting an In-App Purchase**:
    - You can submit your in-app purchase or subscription to App Review as soon as you create it in **App Store Connect**.
    - If you're submitting your first in-app purchase or adding a new in-app purchase type to your app, you'll need to submit it with a new version of your app.
    - To submit an in-app purchase for review, it must have the **Ready to Submit** in-app purchase status.
    - If it doesn't have this status, complete any missing information.
    - Learn how to submit in-app purchases and subscriptions with the **App Store Connect API**¬π.

Remember that the review process ensures quality and safety for users, so make sure your app complies with Apple's guidelines before submitting! üì±üçè
