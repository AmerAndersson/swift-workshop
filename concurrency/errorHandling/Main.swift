/**
* *Assertions and Preconditions
* Assertions and preconditions are checks that happen at runtime. 
* You use them to make sure an essential condition is satisfied before executing any further code.
* If the Boolean condition in the assertion or precondition evaluates to true, code execution continues as usual. 
* If the condition evaluates to false, the current state of the program is invalid; code execution ends, and your app is terminated.
* Assertions and preconditions can be used to ensure that the code you are writing is correct, and
* assertions help you find mistakes and incorrect assumptions during development, and preconditions help you detect issues in production
