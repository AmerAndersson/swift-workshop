/**
42.km converts 42 kilometers to meters using the previously defined km computed property, 
which multiplies the value by 1_000.0 to convert kilometers to meters.
195.m is already in meters, so it uses the m computed property, which returns the value as is.
These two values are then added together to get the total length of a marathon in meters.
This is because a standard marathon race is defined as 42 kilometers and 195 meters long,
which is exactly what the code calculates. The extension youâ€™ve defined for the Double 
type makes it easy to perform these conversions and calculations directly on numeric literals
