# Note

Us humans, we often think that we are our thoughts. When a thought like “I’m not good at this” pops up in your mind, you may believe that thought, identify with it, and see it as “true”. Sounds familiar? Then give this exercise a try:

1. Sit down some place quiet and close your eyes
2. Keep your eyes closed for a while – then, a thought pops up in your mind
3. Watch the thought fly by, like a cloud in the sky, or a leaf on a river
4. Practice a bit with watching the thoughts go by, and see if you can let them go once they’ve flown or floated by
5. Open your eyes again when you’re ready

Now, ask yourself: Who’s doing the watching? It’s you, watching yourself and your thoughts. If that’s true, then what is “me”, “I” and “my thoughts”? Your thoughts may not be as solid as you think. This may lead you to believe that you are not your thoughts, which I think is true. You can watch your thoughts, even watch how you respond to them, and that could give you a sense of clarity, confidence and calm. This exercise is called mindfulness meditation.
